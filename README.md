project five in the course mathematical modeling

In the project, we want to solve an inverse problem about thermal conductivity of a kind of material. The problem consists of a heat equation and we are required to calculate the thermal conductivity through a group of data about tempratures at different positions in a materials with time pass by. 

In our project. First, we set the various material coefficients in the main.py file. Then, the code will generate an Excel file that records the temperature variations of the object at different positions over time. Next, we use the code in the pso.py file to perform the simulation. In fact, the code that solves the inverse problem is contained in pso.py, while main.py is used for data generation and to verify the accuracy of the particle swarm optimization algorithm in pso.py."

And within the heat_condition-main folder, the main.py file can be used to generate a set of temperature distribution plots over time for visualization purposes.
